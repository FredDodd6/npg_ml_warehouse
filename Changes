LIST OF CHANGES

 - to enforce business logic consistency, common parts of lims drivers
   factored out; a driver parent object is created
 - early failure with a clear error message when essential parts of
   a flowcell database record are missing
  
release 39.3
 - added iseq_run_lane_metrics.run_priority to warehouse update (from npg_tracking run.priority)

release 39.2
 - code changes to eliminate warnings when running under Perl 5.22.2
 - PDL return value is now dealt with withing autoqc result objects,
   the warehouse loader can rely on them being either a number
   or undefined
 - Travis CI testing added

release 39.1
 - compensate for loss of split_stats role in npg_qc
  (see https://github.com/wtsi-npg/npg_qc/pull/342)

release 39.0
 - added tests for 'purpose'
 - ml_warehouse lims driver refinments to ensure db connection is
   propagated
 - add run/flowcell level caching st:api:lims driver

release 38.0
 - autonomous ml_warehouse driver which takes query by run id
 - extended ml warehouse loader to load final qc values

release 37.10
 - Corrected calculation of unexpected_tags_percent

release 37.9
 - Try to figure out id_run from IseqProductMetrics if a flowcell
   identifier is provided.
 - daemon to continiously repair foreign keys from iseq_product_metrics
   table in ml warehouse to iseq_flowcell table

release 37.8
 - Load unexpected tag and chimeric fields in iseq_product_metric and 
   iseq_run_lane_metric tables

release 37.7
 - wh loader bug fix to prevent dropping existing product data if
   no new data is available (GCLP staging data not visible from seq farm
   and other way around)  

release 37.6.1
 - update/fix tests to comply with ml_warehouse v1.5 and npg_tracking v84.7 

release 37.6
 - delay wh loader till the run is finished so that we have time to
   update the number of lanes in the npg_tracking db

release 37.5.1
 - DBIx batch insert does not work correctly, leaves some columns empty.
   Reverted to per-row insert.

release 37.5
 - a utility for repairing unset foreign keys from npg product table to
   the flowcell table in the ml warehouse
 - minimise time tables are locked for when loading data to the warehouse
 - use fast batch insert mode

release 37.4
 - fixed a bug in recognising an allowed error in lims data retrieval

release 37.3
 - ml_warehouse driver for st::api::lims
 - ml_warehouse loader - use common code for retrieving flowcell LIMs data from the database

release 37.2
 - loader changes resulting from dropping most of autoqc columns from the run lane metrics
   and removing from this table a foreign key into the flowcell table
 - give preference to batch_id when linking to the flowcell table
 - add explain flag for logging problems linking to tle flowcell table
 - link as much data as possible for a flowcell with duplicate entries
 - retrieve and load data for verify_bam_id check and for normal mode distribution
   in the insert size check

release 37.1
 - add run_is_indexed method to npg tracking data source

release 37.0
 - the following modules
     npg_warehouse::loader::autoqc
     npg_warehouse::loader::npg
     npg_warehouse::loader::qc
     npg_warehouse::loader::run_status
   were moved to this package from the SVN data-handling package (release 36.7).
 - npg_warehouse::loader::run_status module was changed to accomodate
     loading run statuses to the multi-lims (ml) schema defined in WTSI::DNAP::Warehouse::Schema
 - initial version of the module (npg_warehous::loade::run) for loading the analysis data to
     the ml warehouse
 - initial version of scripts for loading run statuses and analysis data to the ml warehouse
